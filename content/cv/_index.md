Developed an interactive Shiny dashboard to visualize cancer risk near facilities. Code available in GitHub. 
- Evaluated questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic such as transmission possibilities in airplanes and airports, in buildings, schools and other common indoor air spaces.  Developed models to understand transmissions in indoor spaces along with creating dashboards in Tableau for the relevant communities to follow local statistics.

## Key Projects

- **PFAS contamination in drinking water**: Mr. Singhal has been actively involved in the ongoing PFAS litigation in multiple districts around the U.S. He has evaluated toxicology and epidemiology of various PFAS including PFOA and PFOS, is familiar with transport and fate (including fractionation issues) of these chemicals and has evaluated the basis of various regulatory values including the latest EPA MCL guidance for PFOA and PFOS. In addition, Mr. Singhal has managed sampling programs to assess levels of PFAS in water, soil, and sediment. He has analyzed those data using traditional statistical methods and with advanced tools such as PCA and supervised and unsupervised clustering methods to infer possible patters in source contributions. Mr. Singhal has created dashboards with interactive mapping tools and interactive graphs for visualization purposes and to aid in analysis during various litigation phases.
- **Ethylene oxide exposures and cancer risk assessment**: Mr. Singhal has been actively involved in litigation surrounding ethylene oxide emissions and the potential cancer risks to the nearby communities. He has evaluated the basis of EPA’s 2016 IRIS cancer potency factor for ethylene oxide, the NIOSH model that it relied upon, and the validity of the linear no-threshold assumption used by the EPA. In addition, Mr. Singhal has helped multiple clients assess their ethylene oxide emissions from their spice and medical device sterilization facilities in order to contextualize and forecast potential cancer risks to the nearby communities based on EPA’s NATA and AirToxScreen evaluations. He has created an online interactive dashboard for the public to visualize cancer risks from ethylene oxide. 
- **Coal ash exposure assessment**: Mr. Singhal evaluated exposures to community from a coal ash spill and to workers involved in the subsequent cleanup. He reviewed site health plans, individual exposure histories, and sampling plans and results to analyze each individual’s exposures to lead, arsenic, and silica from coal ash. 
- **An ML-based recommendation system for rock climbers**: Mr. Singhal developed a recommendation tool similar to Netflix for rock climbers with the idea that a model should be able to predict which routes a climber is likely to enjoy. He first developed a database of rock climbs from publicly available data, using natural language processing (NLP) methods, e.g., bag of words, TF-IDW, and sentiment analysis, to infer inherent parameters about routes (similar to a movie’s parameters) from text descriptions and comments. Using this database, he developed a recommendation model (content filtering, collaboration model, and neural networks) to predict a user’s preference for a certain route. The model is indeed able to learn over time and cross-reference climbers’ preferences to routes’ parameters and make highly relevant inferences. A fully functional API is publicly available and a mobile app is currently in the process of being developed.
- **COVID-19 transmission modeling**: Mr. Singhal helped develop deterministic and stochastic models to understand transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in various indoor air spaces such as grocery stores, restaurants, airplanes and airports.  He developed online tools to track transmissions in the U.S. and also helped developed dashboards using Tableau for schools, universities and local communities to track local statistics. 
- **Risk assessment for radionuclides**: Mr. Singhal conducted assessments to estimate potential health risks from widespread radionuclide contamination in groundwater and soil at a CERCLA site. 
- **Formaldehyde exposures from laminate flooring**: Mr. Singhal led a team of several Exponent and non-Exponent scientists to assess formaldehyde exposures from laminate flooring installed in people’s homes. He and his team collected the largest ever consumer product data set collected to date and developed novel mathematical models to estimate formaldehyde exposures from consumer products.  This work was presented to US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and has since then been published.
- **California Proposition 65 assessment**: Mr. Singhal has 10 years of experience performing California Prop 65 assessments for numerous chemicals including the most litigated ones – lead, cadmium, phthalates, bisphenol-A (BPA) and formaldehyde – in consumer products and food products. 
- **Quality Assessment and Quality Control (QA/QC) programs**: Mr. Singhal has helped many of his consumer product clients develop Prop 65 screening programs as part of their Quality Control programs in order to proactively manage CPSIA and Prop 65 compliance internally. 
- **Evaluation of claims that airborne dust from a former Naval site posed a cancer hazard to the community**. It was claimed that hundreds of persons who lived within ¼ mile of a former Naval base had been exposed to airborne dust (soil) from the facility and that it had entered their homes and was causing adverse health effects. Evaluated air and dust data in order to conduct an assessment. 
- **Air quality assessments**: Mr. Singhal has conducted numerous indoor and ambient air quality assessments using low cost sensors, active sampling, exposure chambers, etc. to determine exposure to pollutants such as benzene, formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and asbestos among others.  
- **Predicting air quality using low cost sensors**: Mr. Singhal is actively researching the use of advanced data science methods such as deep learning to predict air quality.  For example, he is currently building a deep neural network model to predict air quality at any geolocation based on features like weather patterns or even photos taken from someone’s phone. 
- **Biocompatibility assessment for consumer wearables**: Mr. Singhal has helped many of his clients in the tech industry assess dermal sensitization risk from their wearable products.  Wearable products are unique in their composition and in how they are regulated and therefore, also require unique exposure assessment approaches.  Mr. Singhal and his team at Exponent developed seminal methods for estimating allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) risk from wearable devices. This work has also been published. 
- **PBPK model for malathion**: Mr. Singhal updated a PBPK model for malathion using in vivo human data. This work has been published in peer-reviewed literature. 
- **Data analysis and data science**: Mr. Singhal has been helping these companies make the most out of their data by providing ad hoc data analysis services.  His clients have included construction companies, utility companies and consumer products companies.
