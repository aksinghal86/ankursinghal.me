  At the moment, I am working on two key litigation projects -- an environmental forensics project to identify sources of PFOA and PFOS drinking water contamination around the US; and making sense of EPA's IRIS assessment for ethylene oxide and what it actually means in terms of cancer risk to residents near emitting facilities. (<a href='/project/'>See more here</a>)
  
  I have also been developing <a href='/software/'>dashboards in R Shiny</a> so that my clients can visualize results on maps, charts, or tables. I am also trying my hand at learning D3.js. 
  
  Lastly, I continue to spend a lot of time climbing, pushing the limits of my body and mind, and enjoying the mountains for long peak-bagging or backpacking days.
