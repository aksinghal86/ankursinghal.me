description: "I use quantitative data science techniques to solve exposure assessment problems in air, water, and even consumer products. Lately, I have been busy with source attribution of PFOA and PFOS in contaminated drinking water, risk characterization of cancer from ethylene oxide emissions, and interactive dashboards development for clients in a host of platforms, especially R Shiny.
<br><br>
My goal is to bring data science and software development technologies to modernize the field of exposure assessment."
